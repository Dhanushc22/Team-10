- Django apps: `accounts`, `master_data`, `transactions`, `reports`.

### Environment & Configuration
- Frontend base URL: `REACT_APP_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api`)
- Backend CORS allows `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Backend DB: SQLite (auto‑created)
- Example backend env: `backend/env.example`

### User Roles & Permissions

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system implements comprehensive role-based access control with three distinct user types:

**1. 👑 Admin (Business Owner)**
- **Level of Access**: Full access (superuser)
- **Django Admin Access**: ✅ Full access
- **Permissions**: All 96 permissions
- **What they can do**:
  - Create, modify, or archive all master data (Contacts, Products, Taxes, Chart of Accounts)
  - Record all types of transactions (PO, SO, Vendor Bills, Invoices, Payments)
  - View all reports (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, Stock Report, Partner Ledger)
  - Manage user roles (create Invoicing User accounts, deactivate them)
  - Export reports (Excel/PDF)
- **What they cannot do**: Nothing is restricted

**2. 📝 Invoicing User (Accountant)**
- **Level of Access**: Transaction + Master Data (but limited)
- **Django Admin Access**: ✅ Limited access
- **Permissions**: 63 permissions (Master Data + Transactions)
- **What they can do**:
  - Create master data (Contacts, Products, Taxes, Chart of Accounts)
  - Record transactions: Purchase Orders, Vendor Bills, Sales Orders, Customer Invoices, Payments
  - View reports: Balance Sheet, P&L, Stock Report
  - Download reports for accounting purposes
- **What they cannot do**:
  - Modify Admin-only settings (e.g., cannot delete/archive existing Chart of Accounts)
  - Cannot manage other users
  - Cannot view reports unrelated to their role

**3. 👤 Contact User (Customer or Vendor)**
- **Level of Access**: Restricted (own data only)
- **Django Admin Access**: ❌ No access
- **Permissions**: 3 permissions (View own data only)
- **What they can do**:
  - View only their own invoices or bills
  - Customer → sees sales invoices issued to them
  - Vendor → sees purchase orders/bills issued to them
  - Make payments against their invoices (Cash/Bank/UPI link)
  - Download their invoices/bills in PDF
- **What they cannot do**:
  - Cannot access master data (Contacts, Products, Taxes, CoA)
  - Cannot view or edit other users' invoices
  - Cannot access financial reports (Balance Sheet, P&L, Stock)

**4. ⚙️ System (Automated Role)**
- **Level of Access**: Invisible backend actor
- **What it does**:
  - Validates data consistency (e.g., correct tax % against HSN code)
  - Computes taxes during transactions automatically
  - Updates stock ledgers and financial ledgers in real time
  - Generates financial reports (Balance Sheet, P&L, Stock) on demand
- **What it cannot do**: It does not initiate transactions — only processes what users input

#### User Model
`accounts.models.User` extends `AbstractUser`:
- Login by email (`USERNAME_FIELD='email'`), email is unique.
- Fields: `mobile`, `role` (admin|invoicing_user|contact), `profile_image`, `is_verified`, timestamps.

### Database Structure & Architecture

#### Database Overview
The Shiv Accounts system uses a **relational database** with **13 core tables** organized into 3 main categories:

1. **👥 User Management** (1 table)
2. **📋 Master Data** (4 tables) 
3. **💼 Transactions** (8 tables including line items)

#### Core Tables Structure

**1. User Management**
- `users` - Authentication & role-based access control
  - Primary fields: email (unique), role, first_name, last_name, mobile
  - Relationships: OneToOne with contacts, OneToMany with all transactions

**2. Master Data Tables**
- `contacts` - Customers & Vendors
  - Primary fields: name, type (customer/vendor/both), email, mobile, address
  - Relationships: OneToOne with users, OneToMany with transactions
- `products` - Goods & Services
  - Primary fields: name, type, sales_price, purchase_price, tax_percent, hsn_code
  - Relationships: OneToMany with all line item tables
- `taxes` - GST & Tax Configurations
  - Primary fields: name, computation_method, percentage_value, applicable_on
  - Relationships: Referenced by tax calculations
- `chart_of_accounts` - Financial Account Hierarchy
  - Primary fields: name, type (asset/liability/income/expense/equity), code, parent
  - Relationships: Self-referencing hierarchy, used in reports

**3. Transaction Tables**
- `sales_orders` + `sales_order_items` - Customer orders with line items
- `purchase_orders` + `purchase_order_items` - Vendor orders with line items
- `customer_invoices` + `customer_invoice_items` - Sales invoices with line items
- `vendor_bills` + `vendor_bill_items` - Purchase bills with line items
- `payments` + `payment_allocations` - Payment processing & allocation

#### Key Database Relationships

```
User (1) ──→ (*) All Transactions (created_by)
User (1) ──→ (0..1) Contact (portal access)

Contact (1) ──→ (*) Sales Orders (customer)
Contact (1) ──→ (*) Purchase Orders (vendor)
Contact (1) ──→ (*) Customer Invoices (customer)
Contact (1) ──→ (*) Vendor Bills (vendor)
Contact (1) ──→ (*) Payments (contact)

Product (1) ──→ (*) All Line Items (product)

SalesOrder (1) ──→ (*) CustomerInvoices (conversion)
PurchaseOrder (1) ──→ (*) VendorBills (conversion)
Payment (1) ──→ (*) PaymentAllocations (distribution)
```

#### Data Flow Patterns

**Sales Order Creation Flow:**
1. Frontend form submission with validation
2. API call: `POST /api/transactions/sales-orders/create-with-items/`
3. Backend creates sales_orders record + multiple sales_order_items
4. Automatic total calculations and validation
5. Response with created document data

**Payment Processing Flow:**
1. Payment entry form
2. API call: `POST /api/transactions/payments/quick-allocate/`
3. Backend creates payment + payment_allocation records
4. Updates invoice/bill paid_amount and balance_due
5. Auto-updates status when fully paid

**Dashboard Data Flow:**
1. Frontend request: `GET /api/auth/dashboard-data/`
2. Backend queries multiple tables for aggregations
3. Real-time calculations for KPIs
4. JSON response for dashboard display

#### Data Security & Access Control

**Role-Based Data Filtering:**
- **Admin**: Full access to all tables and records
- **Invoicing User**: All tables except user management
- **Contact**: Only own records via user relationship filtering

**Contact User Data Isolation:**
```python
# Contact users see only their own invoices
CustomerInvoice.objects.filter(customer__user=request.user)

# Contact users see only their own bills  
VendorBill.objects.filter(vendor__user=request.user)
```

#### Database Performance Features
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Calculated fields (totals) stored for performance
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient pagination for large datasets
- Query optimization with select_related/prefetch_related

### Conventions
- Backend
  - Domain‑oriented Django apps
  - DRF pagination and filters where relevant
  - Default permission is authenticated; Token and Session auth enabled
- Frontend
  - Functional components + hooks; API isolated in `services/api.js`
  - Routing in `App.js`; protected routes
  - Tailwind utility classes for styling

### Error Handling
- 401: token cleared and redirect to `/login`
- Validation errors surfaced in forms and toasts
- React Query handles request errors and loading states

### Security & Production Readiness

#### Current Security Features ✅
