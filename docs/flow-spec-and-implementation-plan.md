## Shiv Accounts Cloud – Flow Spec and Implementation Plan (from UI Blueprint)

### 0) Purpose
This document translates the provided blueprint image into a concrete, buildable specification. It lists screens, flows, data requirements, validations, permissions, API endpoints, and a prioritized delivery plan tied to the current codebase.

---

### 1) Actors and Role Gating
- Admin (Business Owner)
  - Full access. Can manage users, all master data, all transactions, reports
- Invoicing User (Accountant)
  - Master data CRUD, transactions CRUD, reports view; no user management
- Contact (Customer/Vendor)
  - Self-service: view own invoices/bills and pay

Route targets after login:
- Admin → /dashboard
- Invoicing → /invoicing-dashboard
- Contact → /contact-dashboard

---

### 2) Master Data (Screens + Fields)
1) Contact Master
   - Fields: name, type (customer/vendor/both), email, mobile, address, city, state, pincode, profile image
   - Actions: create, edit, soft-delete (is_active=false), search, filter by type
2) Product Master
   - Fields: name, type (goods/service), sales_price, purchase_price, sale_tax_percent, purchase_tax_percent, hsn_code, category, description
   - Actions: create, edit, soft-delete, search, filter by type
3) Tax Master
   - Fields: name, computation_method (percentage/fixed_value), applicable_on (sales/purchase/both), percentage_value, fixed_value, description
   - Actions: create, edit, soft-delete
4) Chart of Accounts
   - Fields: name, type (asset/liability/expense/income/equity), code, parent, opening_balance, current_balance, description
   - Actions: create, edit, soft-delete

Status: All 4 master pages are wired with CRUD UI and backend endpoints.

---

### 3) Transactions (Documents and Flows)
Core docs:
- Purchase Order (PO) → Vendor Bill (AP)
- Sales Order (SO) → Customer Invoice (AR)
- Payments (customer/vendor), allocations against invoices/bills

3.1 Sales Order
- Header: so_number (auto), so_date, customer, delivery_date, payment_terms, status (draft/confirmed/delivered/cancelled)
- Lines: product, quantity, unit_price, tax_percent; totals: subtotal, tax_total, grand_total
- Actions: create, edit, list, convert to customer invoice

3.2 Customer Invoice
- Header: invoice_number (auto), invoice_date, due_date, customer, payment_terms, reference (SO), status (pending/paid/overdue/cancelled)
- Lines: product, quantity, unit_price, tax_percent; totals: subtotal, tax_total, grand_total, paid_amount, balance_due
- Actions: record/allocate payment, list/detail view

3.3 Purchase Order
- Header: po_number (auto), po_date, vendor, delivery_date, payment_terms, status (draft/sent/received/cancelled)
- Lines: product, quantity, unit_price, tax_percent; totals like SO
- Actions: create, edit, list, convert to vendor bill

3.4 Vendor Bill
- Header: bill_number (auto), bill_date, due_date, vendor, purchase_order (ref), status (pending/paid/overdue/cancelled)
- Lines: product, quantity, unit_price, tax_percent; totals incl. paid_amount, balance_due
- Actions: record/allocate payment, list

3.5 Payments
- Fields: payment_number (auto), payment_type (customer_payment/vendor_payment), contact, payment_date, payment_method (cash/bank/cheque/online), amount, allocations[]
- Actions: create payment and allocate; quick-allocate convenience for settling a single invoice/bill

Status:
- Backend list/create/detail endpoints exist for SO/PO/Invoice/Bill/Payment
- Added conversion endpoints: SO→Invoice, PO→Bill
- Added quick payment allocate endpoint
- Frontend: List pages + Convert buttons + Quick Pay buttons wired (needs create/edit forms for SO/PO/Invoice/Bill)

---

### 4) Reports
- Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities, Equity)
- Profit & Loss (Income – Expenses)
- Stock Report (Qty in/out/available, valuation)
- Partner Ledger (per contact statement)

Status:
- Placeholder report pages exist
- Backend to implement minimal aggregates (milestone below)

---

### 5) Validations & Business Rules (from blueprint and domain)
- Master data fields: required constraints for name/type, numeric >= 0, percentages within 0–100
- Line totals: total = qty × price + tax; document totals are sums of lines
- Status transitions: draft → confirmed → delivered; invoice/bill: pending → paid/overdue
- Payments update paid_amount and recompute balance_due; prevent over-allocation
- Soft deletes on masters; do not orphan references
- Role gating on conversion and payments (admin or invoicing)

---

### 6) API Surface (delta)
- Implemented:
  - POST /api/transactions/sales-orders/:id/convert-to-invoice/
  - POST /api/transactions/purchase-orders/:id/convert-to-bill/
  - POST /api/transactions/payments/quick-allocate/
- To add (after forms):
  - POST/PUT SO with items
  - POST/PUT PO with items
  - POST/PUT Invoice/Bill with items
  - Payment with multiple allocations

---

### 7) Frontend Work Breakdown
Done:
- Invoicing Dashboard with pending lists and Quick Pay
- User Management (admin), Profile page
- Master Data CRUD for Contacts, Products, Taxes, CoA
- Transactions: list pages, convert actions, quick pay

Next:
1) SO/PO create-edit forms with line items & tax calc
   - Components: LineItemsTable (add/remove rows, totalling)
   - Persist via transactionsAPI (new endpoints)
2) Invoice/Bill create-edit forms; show allocations
3) Payment form (split allocations, validation, method fields)
4) Reports minimal back-end (aggregations) + UI tables
5) Polish role-based navigation/redirects

---

### 8) Milestones & Timeline
M1 (Today): Spec + plan (this file), wire conversions and quick pay [DONE]
M2 (Next): SO/PO create-edit forms with items + API
M3: Invoice/Bill edit forms + allocations
M4: Payments full UX (multi-allocation)
M5: Reports (BS, P&L, Stock) minimal backend + UI
M6: QA pass, fixtures, and docs

---

### 9) Risks & Edge Cases
- Overpayments/negative balances; enforce min(allocate, balance_due)
- Tax calculations consistency between front and back
- Concurrency on payments and conversions
- Contact role mapping to user accounts (when to auto-create)

---

### 10) Acceptance Checklist
- Masters: CRUD + filters complete
- Transactions: SO/PO forms with itemised totals; conversion works
- Invoices/Bills: payments reduce balances; status flips to paid when balance zero
- Reports: BS/P&L/Stock render basic accurate aggregates
- Role gating: Admin/Invoicing/Contact experiences distinct
